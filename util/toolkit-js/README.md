# Toolkit (JS)

For docs on maintaining this code, see [Maintenance](#Maintenance).

## Usage

The toolkit provides commands for executing `compactc` compiled contracts. It requires a configuration file, written
in TypeScript, that provides a _binding_ between the compiled contract (i.e., the generated `compactc` output),
and its assets. Often, compiled contracts require the implementation of witnesses that perform some utility for
the contract in regard to the caller's private state. The configuration file can provide these witness implementations.

An example of the `'contract.config.ts'` file is shown below:

```ts
/**
 * This module provides configuration to the `node-toolkit(js)` command line. Like most JS/TS based configuration
 * files, it is an executable module that has a _default_ export, which for our purposes, defines:
 *
 * 1. A built _contract executable_. This is a binding between a compiled contract (i.e., the generated `compactc`
 * output) and its other logical assets,
 * 2. A function that provides some initial private state,
 * 3. A collection of configuration values (that can also be overridden by environment variables, or on the command
 * line).)
 *
 * @module
 */

import { CompiledContract, ContractExecutable, type Contract } from '@midnight-ntwrk/compact-js/effect';
import { Contract as C_ } from './managed/counter/contract/index.cjs';

/**
 * A type that describes the private state of the contract.
 */
type PrivateState = {
  count: number;
};

// A type alias to the imported Contract type (that binds it to our type of private state).
type CounterContract = C_<PrivateState>;
// Rename the imported Contract constructor so that we have a more distinct name. Unfortunately, `compactc`
// always generates using the name `Contract`.
const CounterContract = C_;

/**
 * An object that represents the witness functions defined by the compiled contract.
 */
const witnesses: Contract.Contract.Witnesses<CounterContract> = {
  // In this example, we simply increment the count stored in our private state.
  private_increment: ({ privateState }) => [{ count: privateState.count + 1 }, []]
}

/**
 * Creates the initial private state to use when deploying new instances of the contract.
 *
 * @returns An initialized object representing {@link PrivateState}.
 */
const createInitialPrivateState: () => PrivateState = () => ({ count: 0 });

export default {
  // Use the imports from `@midnight-ntwrk/compact-js/effect` to build an executable contract (an object)
  // that binds the output from `compactc` to the physical and logical assets that are required for its
  // execution.
  contractExecutable: CompiledContract.make<CounterContract>('CounterContract', CounterContract).pipe(
    // If the contract has no witnesses, then the `witnesses` const can be removed, and use
    // CompiledContract.withVacantWitnesses instead:
    CompiledContract.withWitnesses(witnesses),
    CompiledContract.withCompiledFileAssets('./managed/counter'),
    ContractExecutable.make
  ),
  createInitialPrivateState,
  // Configuration can also be provided here. 
  config: {
    keys: {
      coinPublic: 'd2dc8d175c0ef7d1f7e5b7f32bd9da5fcd4c60fa1b651f1d312986269c2d3c79',
    },
    network: 'undeployed'
  }
}
```

> [!TIP]
> In the examples that follow, when running the command from its own folder, replace `midnight-node-toolkit-js`
with `./dist/bin.js` or `npm start`. The binary name will only be registered when the package is installed globally.
>
> Note: If you run via `npm start`, then you'll need to separate the toolkit arguments from `npm`s by adding a `--`.  
> E.g., `npm start -- deploy ...`

#### Global Options
The following global options can be used across all commands:

- `-c | --config <file>`  
**Optional** A path to the contract configuration file.  
Defaults to using `'contract.config.ts'` in the working directory.

- `-o | --output <file>`  
**Optional** A path to the where the produced 'Intent' data should be serialized.  
Defaults to writing to `'output.bin'` in the working directory.

The following global options can be used across all commands, and may be provided as values in the contract
configuration file, through environment variables, or via its command line option:

- `-p | --coin-public <key>` (`KEYS_COIN_PUBLIC=<key>`)  
A user public key capable of receiving Zswap coins, in hex or Bech32m format.
```ts
config: {
  keys: {
    ...
    coinPublic: '<key>'
    ...
  }
}
```

#### Deploying
```bash
midnight-node-toolkit-js deploy [...global_options] [-s | --signing <key>] <arg>...
```

#### Options
The `deploy` command accepts the following options, and may be provided as values in the contract configuration
file, through environment variables, or via its command line option:

- `-s | --signing <key>` (`KEYS_SIGNING=<key>`)  
**Optional** A BIP-340 signing key, in hex format.  
A signing key is used to create a Contract Maintenance Authority (CMA) when initializing the new contract. It is
used to create a verifying key that is included in the contract deployment data that will be included in the
serialized Intent.
```ts
config: {
  keys: {
    ...
    signing: '<key>'
    ...
  }
}
```

#### Arguments
Arguments are forwarded to the contract constructor in the order in which they are received on the command line.

#### Circuit Invocation
```bash
midnight-node-toolkit-js circuit [...global_options] --input <file> <address> <circuit_id> <arg>...
```

#### Options
The `circuit` command accepts the following options via the command line:

- `-i | --input <file>`  
A path to a file containing the serialized onchain (or Ledger) state that represents the _current_ state of
the contract. The executing circuit will apply to this given state.

- `--output-events <file>`
**Optional** A path to a file where the contract log events emitted during circuit execution are written as
JSON (the raw `LogEvent[]`; `bigint` values are serialized as decimal strings and byte arrays as number
arrays). Events are only written when this option is supplied.
Requires `COMPACTC_VERSION` ≥ 0.33.0 — earlier variants predate the compact-js events API and do not accept
this flag. (When driven through the Rust toolkit, requesting events on an older version fails early with a
clear error; passing `--output-events` directly to an older toolkit-js instead yields a confusing
"Invalid number of arguments" error, because `@effect/cli` absorbs the unknown flag into the trailing
variadic arguments.)

#### Arguments
The `circuit` command requires the following arguments:

- `address`  
The contract address.

- `circuit_id`  
The name of the circuit that is to be invoked.

Any remaining arguments are forwarded to the contract circuit in the order in which they are received on the
command line.

#### Contract Maintenance
```bash
midnight-node-toolkit-js maintain contract [...global_options] --input <file> <address> <circuit_id> <arg>...
```

#### Options
The `maintain contract` command accepts the following options via the command line:

- `-i | --input <file>`  
A path to a file containing the serialized onchain (or Ledger) state that represents the _current_ state of
the contract.

- `-s | --signing <key>` (`KEYS_SIGNING=<key>`)  
**Optional** A BIP-340 signing key, in hex format.  
The signing key to use when signing the maintenance update data.

#### Arguments
The `maintain contract` command requires the following arguments:

- `address`  
The contract address.

- `new_signing_key`  
The new signing key to use in future maintenance operations. Note: This should not be the same as the key
specified with the `-s | --signing` option.

#### Circuit Maintenance
```bash
midnight-node-toolkit-js maintain circuit [...global_options] --input <file> <address> <circuit_id> <arg>...
```

#### Options
The `maintain contract` command accepts the following options via the command line:

- `-i | --input <file>`  
A path to a file containing the serialized onchain (or Ledger) state that represents the _current_ state of
the contract.

- `-s | --signing <key>` (`KEYS_SIGNING=<key>`)  
**Optional** A BIP-340 signing key, in hex format.  
The signing key to use when signing the maintenance update data.

#### Arguments
The `maintain contract` command requires the following arguments:

- `address`  
The contract address.

- `circuit_id`  
The name of the circuit to maintain.

- `verifier_key_path`  
**Optional** A path to the verifier key to insert or update for the circuit identified by `circuit_id`. If not
present, the `circuit_id` is removed from the contract state.

## Supporting multiple `compactc` versions

A given `compactc` release emits contract code that expects a matching `@midnight-ntwrk/compact-js*` line (and,
transitively, a matching `@midnight-ntwrk/compact-runtime`). To let one toolkit drive contracts compiled by
different `compactc` versions, each supported version has its own sibling workspace that pins that line:

```
compact-0.29.0/     → @midnight-ntwrk/compact-js* 2.4.3   (public npm)
compact-0.30.0/     → @midnight-ntwrk/compact-js* 2.5.0   (public npm)
compact-0.31.0/     → @midnight-ntwrk/compact-js* 2.5.1   (public npm)
compact-0.33.0/     → @midnight-ntwrk/compact-js* 2.5.5-rc.7 (public npm)
compact-0.34.0/     → @midnight-ntwrk/compact-js* 2.5.5-rc.8 (compactc 0.34.0; public npm)
```

The root package depends on every variant (`@midnight-ntwrk/node-toolkit-compact-<major>.<minor>.<patch>`). At
runtime, `src/compactc-resolver.ts` reads `COMPACTC_VERSION`, picks the matching variant, and installs a
module-resolution hook that redirects **every** `@midnight-ntwrk/compact-js*` / `@midnight-ntwrk/compact-runtime`
import — including the transitive ones reached while a `contract.config.ts` is loaded — to that variant's pinned
copy. `src/bin.ts` (the CLI) and `test/setup-compactc-resolver.ts` (the tests) both use this single resolver, so
tests exercise the same dispatch as production.

Dispatch is on the full `<major>.<minor>.<patch>` version, since a `compactc` patch can ship a contract format
that expects a different `@midnight-ntwrk/compact-js` patch. `COMPACTC_VERSION` may also carry a trailing
build/tree-hash suffix (e.g. `0.31.0-6587676a9bb2`, the form stored in the root `COMPACTC_VERSION` file); only the
leading `<major>.<minor>.<patch>` is matched.

### Adding support for a new `compactc` version

1. **Create the variant workspace.** Copy an existing one, e.g. `cp -r compact-0.31.0 compact-<major>.<minor>.<patch>`.
   In its `package.json`:
   - set `"name"` to `@midnight-ntwrk/node-toolkit-compact-<major>.<minor>.<patch>`;
   - pin `@midnight-ntwrk/compact-js`, `@midnight-ntwrk/compact-js-command`, and `@midnight-ntwrk/compact-js-node`
     to the line that targets the new `compactc`;
   - align the `@effect/*` versions (`@effect/cli`, `@effect/platform-node`) with what that `compact-js` line
     expects — they have shifted between releases.

   The variant's `src/index.ts` rarely needs changes; it just re-exports the commands assembled from its pinned
   `compact-js-command`.

2. **Register the version** in `src/compactc-resolver.ts`: add it to `SUPPORTED_COMPACTC_VERSIONS`. To make it
   the pinned default, bump the root `COMPACTC_VERSION` file (and the `compact/` submodule) instead — there is no
   default baked into the resolver.

3. **Depend on the variant** from the root `package.json` `dependencies`
   (`"@midnight-ntwrk/node-toolkit-compact-<major>.<minor>.<patch>": "^0.1.0"`). The `compact-*` workspaces glob
   picks it up automatically.

4. **Add the concrete patch version** to `DEFAULT_VERSIONS` in `scripts/test-all-compactc.sh`.

5. **Install, build, and test:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build          # builds every variant + the root dispatcher
   npm run test:compat    # recompiles the test contract with each compactc and runs the suite per version
   ```

To drop an old version, reverse these steps: remove it from `SUPPORTED_COMPACTC_VERSIONS`, the root dependency,
and the test script, then delete the `compact-<major>.<minor>.<patch>/` workspace.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The CLI option surface can change between `compactc`/`compact-js-command` versions. For example, the global
> `--network` / `-n` option was removed in the 0.31 line (network is taken from the `config.network` field in
> `contract.config.ts` instead). Because `effect/cli` absorbs an unrecognized flag and its value into the
> trailing variadic arguments, passing a removed option produces a confusing error such as
> `Invalid number of arguments. Expected 1 arguments, but got 9` rather than "unknown option". When a command
> that worked under one version fails under another, check whether an option was added or removed.
