# Run the toolkit-js test suite against every supported compactc version.
#
# For each version we recompile the test contract(s) with that compactc (so the generated `managed/`
# output expects that version's `compact-runtime`), then run vitest with COMPACTC_VERSION set. The test
# setup (`test/setup-compactc-resolver.ts`) installs the same module-resolution hook the CLI uses, so
# every `compact-js*` / `compact-runtime` import resolves to the matching variant workspace.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/test-all-compactc.sh                 # all supported versions
#   ./scripts/test-all-compactc.sh 0.30.0 0.31.0   # a subset

# pin every iteration below to that one compiler and silently defeat the whole compatibility suite.
# Unset it so each iteration fetches and compiles with the COMPACTC_VERSION it actually requested.
