	//! There is no pending `AuthorityKeys` shape change yet (`SessionKeys` is still aura + grandpa),

	//!
	//! 1. Update [`LegacySessionKeys`] and its `From` impl to match the pre-upgrade shape.

	//!    version **at the moment this migration is wired in** (see
	//!    [`pallet_session_validator_management::pallet::Pallet`]'s `#[pallet::storage_version]`).
	//! 3. After the upgrade that runs this migration has landed on all live networks, remove the
	//!    migration from `SingleBlockMigrations` **before** any genesis reset (devnet/qanet wipe) that
	//!    builds state at the post-migration pallet version with the new `AuthorityKeys` shape. If the
	//!    migration is still wired while on-chain storage remains at `FROM` but genesis already stores
	//!    new-shaped committee bytes, the next upgrade will run `translate::<OldCommitteeInfo, _>(...)`
